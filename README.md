# Requirements
This script requires Python 3.10 to run.
No command line options.  It will prompt for a directory, and will search that directory tree for POIs.

# TeragonPOIParser
A utility script for automatically generating the text needed to load POIs in to Teragon's "Read POI Properties List" when given a directory containing custom POIs.
 
 _Note that you will still need to use the 'Add Source Path' command and point to your POI directory for Teragon to recognize and correctly place POIs._
 
 This script requires Python3 to run, and some basic knowledge of Python and scripts is assumed.  Always be careful when running random scripts you download off the internet, even if they're from someone as trustworthy as me. 
 
 Teragon is an advanced map generator for 7 Days to Die.
